## 🧩 Prerequisites

Before starting, you must have:

- An **AWS EC2 Instance** (Amazon Linux 2 Recommended)
- Security Group with inbound rule:
```

Port 8080 → 0.0.0.0/0

````
- Internet connectivity
- SSH access to your EC2 instance

# 🛠️ Jenkins Installation Guide (Amazon Linux 2)

---

## 1️⃣ Update Your System
```bash
sudo yum update -y
````

---

## 2️⃣ Install Java (Required for Jenkins)

```bash
sudo yum install java-amazon -y
```

Verify Java:

```bash
java -version
```

---

## 3️⃣ Add Jenkins Repository

```bash
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo<<EOF
[jenkins]
name=Jenkins-stable
baseurl=https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
EOF
```

---

## 4️⃣ Install Jenkins

sudo yum install jenkins -y
```

---

## 5️⃣ Start and Enable Jenkins

## 6️⃣ Access Jenkins in Browser

Open:

```
http://<EC2-Public-IP>:8080
```

---

## 7️⃣ Get Initial Admin Password

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy → Paste → Continue setup.

---

# 🔌 Installing Plugins

Inside Jenkins:

```
Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Plugins
```

Install:

* Git
* GitHub
* Pipeline
* Blue Ocean (optional)
* Credentials Binding

---

# 📜 First Jenkins Pipeline

Create a pipeline job → Add this **Jenkinsfile**:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo "Welcome to Jenkins 101 by Team SkyOps!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run → You’ll see logs in console output.

# 🩺 Troubleshooting (Common Issues)

### ❌ Pipeline stuck in queue

Cause: Not enough executors
Fix:

```
Manage Jenkins → Nodes → Built-In Node → Number of Executors = 2
```

---

### ❌ Jenkins offline

Fix:

```
Dashboard → Build Executor Status → Mark as online
```

---

### ❌ Cannot access Jenkins

Fix: Open security group port `8080`

---

### ❌ Disk full

Fix:

* Clean `/tmp` and `/var/lib/jenkins/workspace`
* Or expand EC2 EBS volume
